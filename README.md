# RoboCar – Obstacle Avoidance Educational Robot  
### 📅 Date: December 4, 2024  
### 📍 Course: EGN 3000L  
### 👥 Team: Group 10  
### 🔧 Role: Software Lead  

## 📌 Overview  
Developed **RoboCar**, an interactive and educational robot designed for **K-8 students** to learn about **road safety** using obstacle detection technology.

## 🚀 Key Contributions & Development  
- 🖥 **Software Development**: Programmed obstacle avoidance using **Arduino**, **ultrasonic sensors**, and **LCD display** to indicate movement directions.  
- 🔧 **Engineering & Prototyping**: Designed a **6"x6"x6"** chassis (initially intended to be **3D printed**, later built from **cardboard** due to constraints).  
- 🤖 **Obstacle Avoidance System**: Implemented logic where the robot moves forward, stops, or turns based on sensor readings (**distance thresholds: 15 cm, 30 cm, 45 cm**).  
- 💰 **Cost & Accessibility**: Designed for **under $20**, with a **5-step setup**, making it easy for educators to integrate into classrooms.  

## 🛠 Technology Stack  
- **Arduino (C++)**  
- **LiquidCrystal_I2C.h** for LCD integration  
- **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor** for obstacle detection  
- **L298N Motor Driver** for motor control  
- **9V Battery-Powered**  

## 🔍 Future Improvements  
- ✅ **Enhance Durability**: Replace **cardboard chassis** with **stronger materials**  
- ✅ **Improve Sensors**: Enhance **obstacle detection** for diverse environments  
- ✅ **Wireless Control**: Implement **Bluetooth/Wi-Fi** for remote interaction  
- ✅ **Expand Educational Scope**: Integrate **more road safety lessons** aligned with school curricula
